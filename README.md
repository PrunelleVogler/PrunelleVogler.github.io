Hello! Iâ€™m Prunelle Vogler, and this is my personal website where you can find my CV and research work.

## About Me

I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Mathematics at EPFL (Lausanne) since January 2025.

## Curriculum Vitae

You can view my CV [here](cv.md).

## Research

I work on topics related to operation research, game theory and their applications to environmental and social issues. Check out my research work [here](research.md).

## Other interests

I'm also very interested in the place of science in society: the history of science, man's relationship with scientific truth, and critiques of technological progress as the only horizon for today's sciences. You can find documentation and material for reflection on these subjects [here](politics.md).
